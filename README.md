# Multisensory Stimuli Presentation

*Author: Zizhuang Miao*

*05/21/2020*

This repo contains codes that can replicate parts of the stimuli presentation of a published paper on multisensory representation (Paraskevopoulos et al., 2018). The running of the codes requires a [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) environment containing the [Psychtoolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org/) package. Clone the whole repo, run `MainExp.mlx`, and you can run the experiment (mostly) as Paraskevopoulos and colleagues (2018) did.

For details of the stimuli and experiment parameters, see `ExperimentDetails.pdf` (in Chinese).
